      <title>Winning a Debate at The Soho Forum</title>

      <description>The Soho Forum is an Oxford-style debate series that takes place in NYC. So far there have been 39 debates(and one &amp;ldquo;discussion&amp;rdquo;).
Oxford-style means that the audience is polled on the resolution before and after the debate and the winner is decided by comparing the two polls. At The Soho Forum, the person increasing their vote percentage point more is considered the winner. Though there are alternative ways to score an Oxford-style debate, which I will be looking at at a later date.</description>

      <description>What&#39;s better than America&#39;s fourth favorite sport - Real World/Road Rules Challenge? Not many things I can think of.
To start the search for the True Statistical Challenge GOAT, looking at the elimination challenges is a good(easy) place to go. While not the be-all and end-all, they are straightforward one-on-one(usually) competitions unlike many daily and final challenges. Ignoring social and political games, these are mostly a measure of physical skill.</description>

      <description>A few days ago Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 37 points in 21 minutes against the New York Knicks. That made me really wonder if that&#39;s the most points anyone&#39;s ever scored in the NBA in 21 minutes. Well, turns out, it isn&#39;t. The most anyone ever scored in 21 minutes was Quintin Dailey	who scored 38 points in 1986.
And here is a hard to read visualization of the top scorers at each minute played since the 1983-84 season:  (Click for bigger)</description>

      <title>Comparing RAPTOR and RPM</title>

      <description>When fivethirtyeight.com launched their new all-in-one NBA player ratings before the 2019-20 season, it was very exciting, very exciting indeed. That rating is called RAPTOR.
We can only guess how it&#39;s made or what it means but it does offer an alternative to ESPN&#39;s Real Plus-Minus, which some consider to be the best all-in-one rating. It&#39;s impossible to say which one is more &amp;ldquo;accurate&amp;rdquo; (it isn&#39;t but I shan&#39;t be doing it today) but we can compare the two rating systems in how their evaluations of players differ.</description>

      <title>Tracking The UFC PPV Sales</title>
      <link>https://martj42.github.io/post/tracking-the-ufc-ppv-sales/</link>

      <description>(Click for bigger)
With UFC moving their pay-per-view events exclusively behind ESPN&#39;s paywall in 2019 and thus ending any access to accurate sales numbers, it&#39;d be a fitting time to look back at the numbers for the whole run.
The biggest PPV events are highlighted by text and color-grouped by the star fighter: Conor McGregor, Ronda Rousey, Brock Lesnar, Georges St. Pierre, and Jon Jones.
The vertical dotted line marks the sell of UFC to WMG-IMG.</description>

      <title>Fantasy Basketball Correlation Matrix</title>

      <description>The matrix is based on the 2019-20 NBA season&#39;s per-game standard scores of the top 200 players.
This could be used as a guide for possible punting strategies. There are many players with non-standard statistical contributions, however it might be a good idea to keep within standard lines to have the biggest potential player-base and to minimize categorical waste.
The players can be divided into 3 main groups:
 ft-fg3m-pts-ast-stl blk-reb-fg tov  Based on actual basketball roles, the first two groups are smalls and bigs.</description>
