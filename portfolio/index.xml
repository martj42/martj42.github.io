      <description>This is a website tracking the NBA fantasy league I&#39;ve played in since 2006. The main reason for its creation was that most of the websites hosting fantasy games do not keep the leagues&amp;rsquo; histories.
By now the website is does not only keep the historic records but displays all kinds of statistics of league, which has added greatly to the enjoyment of the game.</description>

      <title>International Football Results Database</title>

      <description>This is a database of every international football result ever. Or quite close to that. I created it before the 2018 World Cup when I couldn&#39;t find a simply formatted results database.
Most of the results were scraped from two websites that don&#39;t exist anymore. Technically, obviously, all the results are out there. Just not in a neat file. But now they are. And they&#39;re updated monthly.
It is one of the most popular datasets on Kaggle.</description>
