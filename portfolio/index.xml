      <description>This is a database of every international football result ever. Or quite close to that. I created it before the 2016 World Cup when I couldn&#39;t find a simply formatted results database.
Most of the results were scraped from two websites that don&#39;t exist anymore. Technically, obviously, all the results are out there. Just not in a neat file. But now they are. And they&#39;re updated monthly.
It is one of the most popular datasets on Kaggle.</description>
