      <description>(Click for bigger)
With UFC moving their pay-per-view events exclusively behind ESPN&#39;s paywall in 2019 and thus ending any access to accurate sales numbers, it&#39;d be a fitting time to look back at the numbers for the whole run.
The biggest PPV events are highlighted by text and color-grouped by the star fighter: Conor McGregor, Ronda Rousey, Brock Lesnar, Georges St. Pierre, and Jon Jones.
The vertical dotted line marks the sell of UFC to WMG-IMG.</description>

      <title>Fantasy Basketball Correlation Matrix</title>

      <description>The matrix is based on the 2019-20 NBA season&#39;s per-game standard scores of the top 200 players.
This could be used as a guide for possible puting strategies. There are many players with non-standard statistical contributions, however it might be a good idea to keep within stardard lines to have the biggest potential player-base and to minimize categorical waste.
The players can be divided into 3 main groups:
 ft-fg3m-pts-ast-stl blk-reb-fg tov  Based on actual basketball roles, the first two groups are smalls and bigs.</description>

      <title>Fantasy League History Website</title>

      <description>This is a website tracking the NBA fantasy league I&#39;ve played in since 2006. The main reason for its creation was that most of the websites hosting fantasy games do not keep the leagues&amp;rsquo; histories.
By now the website is does not only keep the historic records but displays all kinds of statistics of league, which has added greatly to the enjoyment of the game.</description>

      <title>International Football Results Database</title>

      <description>This is a database of every international football result ever. Or quite close to that. I created it before the 2018 World Cup when I couldn&#39;t find a simply formatted results database.
Most of the results were scraped from two websites that don&#39;t exist anymore. Technically, obviously, all the results are out there. Just not in a neat file. But now they are. And they&#39;re updated monthly.
It is one of the most popular datasets on Kaggle.</description>
