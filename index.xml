      <description>A few days ago Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 37 points in 21 minutes against the New York Knicks. That made me really wonder if that&#39;s the most points anyone&#39;s ever scored in the NBA in 21 minutes. Well, turns out, it isn&#39;t. The most anyone ever scored in 21 minutes was Quintin Dailey	who scored 38 points in 1986.
And here is a hard to read visualization of the top scorers at each minute played since the 1983-84 season:  (Click for bigger)</description>

      <title>Comparing RAPTOR and RPM</title>

      <description>When fivethirtyeight.com launched their new all-in-one NBA player ratings before the 2019-20 season, it was very exciting, very exciting indeed. That rating is called RAPTOR.
We can only guess how it&#39;s made or what it means but it does offer an alternative to ESPN&#39;s Real Plus-Minus, which some consider to be the best all-in-one rating. It&#39;s impossible to say which one is more &amp;ldquo;accurate&amp;rdquo; (it isn&#39;t but I shan&#39;t be doing it today) but we can compare the two rating systems in how their evaluations of players differ.</description>

      <title>Tracking The UFC PPV Sales</title>

      <description>(Click for bigger)
With UFC moving their pay-per-view events exclusively behind ESPN&#39;s paywall in 2019 and thus ending any access to accurate sales numbers, it&#39;d be a fitting time to look back at the numbers for the whole run.
The biggest PPV events are highlighted by text and color-grouped by the star fighter: Conor McGregor, Ronda Rousey, Brock Lesnar, Georges St. Pierre, and Jon Jones.
The vertical dotted line marks the sell of UFC to WMG-IMG.</description>

      <title>Fantasy Basketball Correlation Matrix</title>

      <description>The matrix is based on the 2019-20 NBA season&#39;s per-game standard scores of the top 200 players.
This could be used as a guide for possible punting strategies. There are many players with non-standard statistical contributions, however it might be a good idea to keep within standard lines to have the biggest potential player-base and to minimize categorical waste.
The players can be divided into 3 main groups:
 ft-fg3m-pts-ast-stl blk-reb-fg tov  Based on actual basketball roles, the first two groups are smalls and bigs.</description>

      <title>International Football Results Database</title>

      <description>This is a database of every international football result ever. Or quite close to that. I created it before the 2018 World Cup when I couldn&#39;t find a simply formatted results database.
Most of the results were scraped from two websites that don&#39;t exist anymore. Technically, obviously, all the results are out there. Just not in a neat file. But now they are. And they&#39;re updated monthly.
It is one of the most popular datasets on Kaggle.</description>

      <title>Fantasy League History Website</title>

      <description>This is a website tracking the NBA fantasy league I&#39;ve played in since 2006. The main reason for its creation was that most of the websites hosting fantasy games do not keep the leagues&amp;rsquo; histories.
By now the website is does not only keep the historic records but displays all kinds of statistics of league, which has added greatly to the enjoyment of the game.</description>
